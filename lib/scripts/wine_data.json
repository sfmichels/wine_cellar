A full-bodied wine of power and structure, it is crammed with black currants, blackberries, and spices. Its dense fruit is matched blow for blow with a muscular, firm structure. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2020. Score: 94+",

We were blessed by a window of clear, dry weather that allowed the fruit to reach full maturity.  Consequently, this wine is balanced and well structured.  The flavor and mouth feel is enhanced by 18 months of aging in new American oak barrels.  Look for the Alexander Valley fruit aromas of green pepper, beet, blackberry and cassis.  Because the wine has a nice soft mouth feel, it can be enjoyed now with most chicken, grilled meats or hard cheese.  If you would like to age the wine, under proper conditions, it should develop additional complexity.  It may form some sediment as it ages.",

    "other_notes":"In this warm year with its scant spring rains, the York Creek vines again reached \"Late Picked” levels.  We work closely with our growers to harvest at full flavor, but more moderate ripeness.  For the third consecutive year, York Creek has gone beyond that.  To add structure to the very ripe zinfandel, we have included a major amount of petite sirah.  A third of the wine aged in new and one-year-old air-dried american oak barrels, and the rest in similar, tempered oak.  Chalky tannins behind the rich fruit of this massive wine assure it continuing development.  Enjoy now, it will be at its best over the next five to seven years.",

Why not combine these flavors in a pleasant dessert wine--and in addition save the calories of the chocolate mousse. An experience unto itself in the world of wine--the almost Madeira quality of the Port is co-mingled in your nose with a luscious milk chocolate. Hints of black cherry, spice, orange zest and vanilla roam on your palate.A blend of fine California Port was assembled which, without any chocolate addition, was wonderful by itself. It consists of 51% 1994 Tinta Roriz from Madera County, Tinta Roriz being one of the classic Portuguese Port varietals, 28% Cucamonga Valley Tawny Port of mixed vintages, 14% 1995Zinfandel Port and 7% 1991 Malvasia Bianca Port, also from the Cucamonga Valley. It should be noted that the Cucamonga Valley has a long history ofpremium wine making with many vineyards being close to 100 years old. In fact, U.S. Bonded Winery #1 was located in Cucamonga. At this point weturned to two natural chocolate essence producers, one in Southern California, and one in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to create a compatible chocolate essence to match the Port. After numerous sessions of tasting and brain storming the final blend was achieved and was stored in 60 gallon French oak barrels for an added 6 months before bottling. This was done to add complexity.",

Rich in texture with a lingering finish and versatile enough to complement just about any cuisine.",

Drink now through 2013.  123 cases made.”From the March 2005 Siduri newsletter:  We are pleased to introduce our first single-vineyard Pinot Noir from Oregon. The 2003 vintage in Oregon was certainly abnormal in that it was hotter and drier there than it was in California. It seems that the vines that dealt best with this type of heat were the older vines (withdeeper roots) and the older clones (that usually ripen later). The Arbre Vert Vineyard is exactly this type of vineyard as it is 19 years old and planted primarily to an old Charles Coury Pommard selection.The 2003 Siduri Arbre Vert Pinot Noir shows enough forward fruit to appeal to California Pinot Noir fans(especially when paired with food) but enough backbone and restraint to those of you who prefer a moreBurgundian style wine. It shows blackberry, currant, and pepper flavors and a rich medium body. The finish reveals a bit more of the acidity typical of Oregon along with a few tannins that promise positive evolution if cellared for the next several years.",

    "other_notes":"Wine Advocate 90 pts.  We will begin by acknowledging that this wine is not for everyone.If you prefer a well-balanced, higher acid, lower alcohol, more European style wine then you don’t need to read any further. However, if you like a wine with incredible richness, gobs of fruit, and a mouthful of flavor as well as a healthy dose of alcohol then you will love this wine.So how did this wine come into being? It originated in a small vineyard owned by Joe and Gail Judge in  the rocky hills of Bennett Valley. The Judges thinned the vines by hand reducing the normally prolific Grenache to a tiny yield. After harvest, the grapes were fully destemmed, allowed a 5 day cold soak, and then fermented using, appropriately, Grenache yeast. The wine was pressed directly to barrel and aged, without racking for 14 months. Ultimately, half of the barrels made the cut for the single-vineyard wine.We absolutely adore the 2003 Novy Grenache. It is unashamedly over the top. With a combination of fruit and concentration that you just can’t ignore this is a perfect wine for drinking by itself and also with backyard barbecues. It probably won’t make “old bones” (we’ll drink our share before the start of 2006) but it is a blast to drink right now.",

    "other_notes":"Wine Advocate 90 pts.  From the March 2005 Siduri newsletter:  We will begin by acknowledging that this wine is not for everyone.If you prefer a well-balanced, higher acid, lower alcohol, more European style wine then you don’t need to read any further. However, if you like a wine with incredible richness, gobs of fruit, and a mouthful of flavor as well as a healthy dose of alcohol then you will love this wine.So how did this wine come into being? It originated in a small vineyard owned by Joe and Gail Judge in  the rocky hills of Bennett Valley. The Judge’s thinned the vines by hand reducing the normally prolific Grenache to a tiny yield. After harvest, the grapes were fully destemmed, allowed a 5 day cold soak, and then fermented using, appropriately, Grenache yeast. The wine was pressed directly to barrel and aged, without racking for 14 months. Ultimately, half of the barrels made the cut for the single-vineyard wine.We absolutely adore the 2003 Novy Grenache. It is unashamedly over the top. With a combination of fruit and concentration that you just can’t ignore this is a perfect wine for drinking by itself and also with backyard barbecues. It probably won’t make “old bones” (we’ll drink our share before the start of 2006) but it is a blast to drink right now.",

Store site:Medium bodied with clean fruit and a long finish. C&B website: Due to a long warm summer season,both the Napa and Russian River lots were harvested very ripe;in Monterey County,things moved a little more slowly,so the fruit from these vineyards produced more manageable alcohols and flavors that complimented the North Coast fruit very well.The largest portion of the blend (79%)from the Greenfield/Soledad areas of Monterey County displayed lots of the true Pinot character:violet,rose petal,cherry &plum fruit with earthly mocha/herbal ntoes.The remainder of the blend (11%Napa Valley and 10%Russian River)were surprisingly brawny,with wonderful baked black cherry and fig fruit,mineral and licorice flavors bolstering it.And as usual,the Russian River segments were stars,adding refinement in the form of bright,juicy fruit and exotic hints of baking spices and its unique earthiness.While only 21%of the Monterey County elements saw Oak,100 %of the Napa Valley,and Russian River portions spent an average of five months in 75%American and 25%French Oak.",

In the mouth, one was struck immediately by the great palate saturation and thrust of this wine, with the powerful mid-palate coverage giving way to a slowly unwinding finish that lasted 45 seconds. This is the most complete wine I tasted that afternoon, delivering great power, perfect balance, underlying finesse all at the same time.",

Humongous in the mouth, (this one goes to 11) with outrageously sweet fruit, mouthwatering acidity, teeth-staining tannin and that density of palate that you can only get from low yielding vines grown on a rocky hillside.

Not only do you taste the usual big, bright cherries, but also multifaceted aromas of   wet stones and fresh flowers. The wine has a clean, polished feel to it. There is also a hint of sweet fruit that gives the wine a very monstrous presence, and tannins give it structure and a long , lingering finish. This wine has been drinking beautifully since the day we pressed it, and should continue to drink well over the next 5 years.  By the way, for those of you who care about such things, wine writer Robert Parker rated the 2004 Siduri Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir 90-92 points. ",

The concentration of sweet red fruit fills out the mid-palate with the stem inclusion providing complexity on the nose and middle, and length to the finish.",

    "other_notes":"This legendary vineyard located on the bench of Sonoma Mountain, at this point, needs no real introduction. The Van der Kamp family can boast that it had one of the oldest blocks of Pinot Noir grapes planted in Sonoma County (over 45 years old), and has a variety of clones planted (some very young, some teenaged). With that diversity, this wine is always exciting for us to blend because each clone is vinified separately, and kept in separate barrels until the final blend is created. It is very interesting for us to sit down and blend because each block is so different in flavor, texture and aroma. The older vines tend to produce wines that are earthy, rustic and very complex in their herbal characteristics. The younger vines tend to produce energetic, fruit-forward wines. The end result is always an interesting combination.  The 2004 version of this wine ended up begin a mix of four clones: 2 barrels of the older block, 3 barrels of the teenage Martini Clone vines, 1 barrel from the first crop of the new Clone 828 planting, and 5 barrels worth of the 777 clone.  The different blocks were harvested between September 3rd and Sept 14. These were all fermented separately and kept in separate French Oak barrels until blending.

Small lots of malolactic- and barrel-fermented wines are added for complexity. The wine is aged on the yeast lees in the bottle for some two years prior to disgorgement. With its vibrant, fruitful and crisp nature, this sparkling wine will maintain its freshness, structure and refined finish for many years, even decades following its initial release. While this wine can be enjoyed by itself as an apéritif, it is also perfect with fresh oysters and other shellfish, crab cakes, ceviche and grilled sea bass. It is also delicious with lemon chicken and Thai curries. Serve with aged Gouda or other hard cheeses and as a counterpoint to soft triple creams. Tasting Notes “The relatively warm 2004 season delivered a generously flavored Blanc de Blancs with alluring aromas of green apple, citrus and tropical fruits. Rich, tart, Bayview Avenue Carneros Chardonnay form the core, with components ranging from the Marin Coast to the Anderson Valley contributing further depth of fruit. Yeast-derived notes of fresh sourdough and toasted almond blend with hints of crème brûlée. On the palate, this lively sparkler is ripe and crisp with tangy lemon zest early on, progressing to a clean, balanced finish.”  ",

It’s not dark, it has no new oak, and it’s not a fruit bomb.  The wine does possess incredible nuance and layering that extends from the first smell to the very long finish. The wine is barely medium colored owing to its 100% Grenache nature.  We employed 50% whole cluster in the ferment to add varietal character and complexity to both the aromatics and the finish. The stems impart more of what people think of as soil driven characteristics:  black tea, pine needles, dried herbs, lavender, sweet tobacco and sassafras, especially on the nose.  Pure Grenache fruit takes over on the palate.  Again, the stems keep the wine from turning into a one dimensional wine by cutting into the fruit with something savory.  In this case and owing to its Howell Mountain origins, it’s white and black pepper, seared beef, a continuation of the tobacco leaf and something else just beyond description.  It’s definitely a unique experiece as far as California wines go. ",

    "other_notes":"This wine is bound to create some controversy.  For clarity’s sake we feel like we should first explain what this wine isn’t.  It’s not dark, it has no new oak, and it’s not a fruit bomb.  The wine does possess incredible nuance and layering that extends from the first smell to the very long finish. The wine is barely medium colored owing to its 100% Grenache nature.  We employed 50% whole cluster in the ferment to add varietal character and complexity to both the aromatics and the finish. The stems impart more of what people think of as soil driven characteristics:  black tea, pine needles, dried herbs, lavender, sweet tobacco and sassafras, especially on the nose.  Pure Grenache fruit takes over on the palate.  Again, the stems keep the wine from turning into a one dimensional wine by cutting into the fruit with something savory.  In this case and owing to its Howell Mountain origins, it’s white and black pepper, seared beef, a continuation of the tobacco leaf and something else just beyond description.  It’s definitely a unique experiece as far as California wines go. ",

    "other_notes":"The fruit is hugely jammy razzberry with some dusty Asian/Moroccan spices like cumin, coriander and white pepper. It is slowly developing some lovely creamy milk chocolate, as well as a bit of brown sugar in the finish. With 15.1% alcohol, this is a \"humongous\" wine indeed, but does not appear awkwardly hot or overtly alcoholic, just big, chewy, and mouthfilling!On its June release, the 2004 Monga Zin® was still showing a bit chewy tannins and had not opened up much in nose or mouth. That has changed now, and the wine has developed a depth of flavor and complexity that has caught the approval of quite a few judges. It has won 5 Gold medals and the Best of Show at the Jefferson Cup Invitational n MO in December 2004. It has at least 5-7 years ahead before that powerful red fruit fades out.",

Try it with any BBQ, tomato sauces, spicy stuff like chipotle or Szechwan glazes on ribs, and it has a special affinity for game and DUCK.",

Full of freshly-ground black pepper aromas and some nice cedary-spicy oak components, it has a rich creamy mouthfeel despite its firm tannic backbone. This vintage shows a touch of gaminess that I find quite reminiscent of a nice Cotes du Rhone. That wild note is beautifully compatible with game meats, especially duck, or actually with any grilled meats. I also had a nice paring which surprised me—Alaskan halibut with a porcini mushroom sauce.",

The multiple sun exposures and the diverse clonal selection of this vineyard enabled us to be more flexible with our picking dates for an optimum maturity of our different blocks.

The palate is lush with bright fruit flavors and the finish is balanced by perfect acidity.  Try one in 2008, but the patient will be rewarded from 2009 and on.",

Moderate tannins that will soften with time. Rustic elegance. The best expression yet of terroir from this Humboldt vineyard.",

On the palate, this classic Russian River Valley gushes with cherries, cola, red licorice, and warm strawberry rhubarb pie. Finishes with flinty, chalky and earthy tones, rich, and well integrated with sweet oak. Beware this silken offering is seductive, bottle after bottle. Should cellar well for at least 6 - 8 years.

While this is clearly not site specific, this creates a composite immediately identifiable as Southern Rhone. A beautiful fresh rasperry-like robe prepares intense aromas of garrigue and black pepper. Although this has a ripe core of brambly fruit, it leaves a primary impression of intense spice and smoked meat. This can stand firm alongside many a fine Vacqueyras or Gigondas.-- Patrick Mitten, Wine House Staff Notes, January 17, 2008Robert Parker's Wine Advocate:  84 point",

    "other_notes":"The Papera Ranch has a long history, being planted in the 1930s, a long-time single vineyard designated wine by DeLoach Winery, then purchased by Constellation Wines, and ultimately, purchased again by StuartColson.Fortunately, throughout all of this movement one thing has remained constant - the quality of the grapes. The fruit that emerges from the Papera Ranch is simply some of the finest fruit we purchase each year.One thing that distinguishes the Papera from our other Zinfandel Vineyards is the high proportion of Zinfandel vines actually planted in the vineyard. Many of these older vineyards have a number of “mixed blacks” interplanted throughout the vineyard and this often gives the wines a different character. Being almost all Zin, the Novy Papera Ranch bottling possessessoaring aromatics with raspberry and black cherry fruit aromas. The palate is more serious with rich red and black fruit and hints of herbs but also great levels of natural acidity which help keep this hedonistic wine in check. This is everything we want in a Zinfandel!. ",

    "other_notes":"The first two releases from the Sonatera Vine- yard received 91 point ratings . from Robert Parker and the 2005 Pinot received 92 points from Wine Spectator Magazine .  But there’s more to it than great reviews.  There’s also a synergy between the grower and the winery that is vital.  This syn- ergy extends to the farming practices, the commitment of both parties to increasing qual- ity, and even to the grower sup- porting the winery by showing up at tastings and working to- gether to promote the wines.  Marne and Debbie are two of our most passionate growers who strive to increase grape quality every vintage, who are willing to honestly criticize what they have done in the past and work to make improvements in the future and who believe that the best is yet to come both for the Sonatera Vineyard and for Siduri Wines.  These are the types of growers we love. The 2006 Sonatera Vineyard Pinot Noir is certainly as suc- cessful and the past releases and perhaps even surpasses them.  It is a blend of 32% Pommard clone with the remainder equally spread out between 115, 667, and 777 clones.  The wine was aged in 81% new French oak for ten months and, once again, bottled without fining or filtration. Despite its low alcohol (at least these days—it is only 13.6%), the 2006 Sonatera Pinot Noir is one of our darkest and most extracted Pinots.  With black- berry, blueberry, and even hints of pepper and chocolate this impressive Pinot Noir drinks well now but will undoubtedly cellar well for 5+ years.95 Points Connoisseurs’ Guide to Fine Wine",

    "other_notes":"The 2006 Novy Sonoma County Syrah is perhaps the most complex offering we have offered under this label. The wine marries the diverse vineyard locations revealing black cherry, rhubarb, mint, and cocoa powder flavors. There is a distinct cedar note and also an earthy, coal like character. This is a young wine that opens up with several hours of aeration. It can be paired now with hearty dishes but will certainly benefit if tucked away in a cellar for several years.The 2006 Sonoma County Syrah is a blend of fruit from six different vineyards stretching from the warmer northern end of Dry Creek Valley to the cool Bennett Valley. However, that has not always been the case with this wine. Back in 1998, our first year of Novy, we produced 7 barrels of Sonoma County Syrah. Those 7 barrels all came from the same place, the Stage Gulch Vineyard, in the Sonoma Coast appellation. After a couple of vintages we moved on to other sites but continued with the Sonoma County designated wine, using it as an opportunity to blend the richnessof warmer growing areas with the more complex flavors that seem to occur in cooler regions.",

The fruit for the 2006 Flying Goat Cellars wine hails from block 16, a fabulous little hillside bowl interlaced with chunks of limestone – the holy grail of soil for Pinot Noir!There is a definite new world attitude exhibited by the 2006 Pinot Noir, Ranch Santa Rosa. A rich ruby color and a brilliant clarity first entices. Aromas of black cherry, red plum and blueberry burst from the glass and are echoed on the palate with a first sip. This is a big, Sta. Rita Hills styled wine with exuberant proclamations of ripe plums, concentrated blueberries, a hint of pomegranate and sassafras spice. Yet, for all the lively fruit notes, the wine is stylish – a silky texture, superb balance and elegant tannins round out the profile of this vibrant wine. Delightful now, the 2006 Pinot Noir, Rancho Santa Rosa will continue to age gracefully for 5-7 years.",

Full-bodied and brimming with ripe fruit. Drink now.Larner Vineyard is located on the western edge of the Ballard Canyon. This is a small family run vineyard with approximately 40 acres of grapes. The Grenache is planted on a south facing hillside at the top of the vineyard. The soil is very sandy, so there is great drainage and just the right amount of stress on the vines to keep the yields low. My particular section is planted with ENTAV clone 362 which is supposedly the lowest yielding of all Grenache clones. I love working with Grenache from this vineyard and I was once again awestruck by the color and intensity of the fruit. The fruit was fermented using native yeast and pressed off a little sweet straight to barrel to finish primary fermentation. I used 4 three year old French barrels so as not to overshadow the fruit. The wine spent 20 months in 3 year old Allier French oak before bottling in June of 2008.",

Velvety smooth, yet with a fine spine of acid, it is everywhere keyed on youthful cherry-like fruit and is filled in with mildly creamy oak at every stop. A classy and complete package that ranks among Siduri's best efforts in 2006, it is at once irresistible now and seems likely to gain still further refinement with time.",

If concerned first and foremost with bright, but well-ripened, red-cherry fruit, this comparatively complex young Pinot shows varied elements of creme brulee and vanilla in addition to subtle accents of woodsy spice. It is slightly viscous and fairly full at the start but picks up a trim of finishing toughness, and, while it can be enjoyed now with heartier meat entrees, it will benefit from a few years of age.",

The specific site is in the Cotes de Gascogne region, and is an old, densely planted vineyard situated on a south-facing limestone and clay hillside. The grapes were harvested at night to allow for a brief period of cold skin maceration. Fermentation occurred in stainless steel, with the temperature stabilized to a very cool 59-62 degrees Fahrenheit in order to preserve the floral aromatics and fresh tropical and citrus fruit characteristics. Four months ageing on the lies adds a hint of creaminess and roundness to the wine’s texture, but does not mask the racy acidity typical of French Colombard from the Cotes de Gascogne. Served well-chilled, Verve French Colombard will prove a classic match with fish, oysters and other shellfish, salad or goat cheese.",

    "other_notes":"The 2006 Pisoni Estate Pinot Noir possesses very complex aromatics.  It is hard to find wines with a combination of fruit, spice and floral notes.  The fruit-driven notes are the most forward with raspberry and black cherry up front.  More subtle are the baking spices, especially clove aromas.  Also, hints of purple rose petals seem to weave in and out.  The palate broadens out quickly with tight-grained tannins framing the wine.  The tannins turn more velvety as the taper off to a long, fine finish.  2006 is another good year for acid levels, providing great balance to the full-bodied texture.",

The tannins are perfect, slightly more than silky provide the grip that gives the wine structure and a long finish. The finish is polished off by the refreshing swipe of vibrant acidity. This wine will not doubt improve with some cellaring, but it may be hard to resist popping open bottles sooner rather than later.Production: 700 CasesRelease Date: February 2009logo 90 PointsShows an exotic array of flavors, including blackberry and cherry jam, Dr. Pepper, mashed ripe dates, milk chocolate, orage zest and black pepper.

Complex and layered, ending with caressing tannins and a long finish. Drink now through 2014. 703 cases made. –JLlogo 93 PointsTWO STARS:(91-94 points) A highly distinctive wine. Likely to be memorable. As in the previous vintage, so again does the Sonatera Vineyard bottling win the nod as one of Siduri's very best efforts in 2007. Absolutely laden with optimally ripened, black-cherry fruit and filled out with a full measure of seamlessly fit oak, the wine is deep, dense and involving from front to back. Its considerable concentration and deft sense of balance garner it big points in the near term, but it will only get better with age and deserves at least of few years patience.",

    "other_notes":"Upon opening, the 2007 displays aromas of exotic herbs, stem inclusion, earth and menthol. As the wine opens up layers of black cherry, tobacco and anise are exposed. The tannins are perfect, slightly more than silky provide the grip that gives the wine structure and a long finish. The finish is polished off by the refreshing swipe of vibrant acidity. This wine will not doubt improve with some cellaring, but it may be hard to resist popping open bottles sooner rather than later.Production: 700 CasesRelease Date: February 2009logo 90 PointsShows an exotic array of flavors, including blackberry and cherry jam, Dr. Pepper, mashed ripe dates, milk chocolate, orage zest and black pepper. The wine is dry, although it's a little too soft. - S.H.91 PointsEnticing loamy earth, dried currant and black cherry fruit is supple and elegant, medium- to full-bodied. Complex and layered, ending with caressing tannins and a long finish. Drink now through 2014. 703 cases made. –JLlogo 93 PointsTWO STARS:(91-94 points) A highly distinctive wine. Likely to be memorable. As in the previous vintage, so again does the Sonatera Vineyard bottling win the nod as one of Siduri's very best efforts in 2007. Absolutely laden with optimally ripened, black-cherry fruit and filled out with a full measure of seamlessly fit oak, the wine is deep, dense and involving from front to back. Its considerable concentration and deft sense of balance garner it big points in the near term, but it will only get better with age and deserves at least of few years patience.",

This site has given us a wine that combines the deep, dark, voluptuous cherry we expect out of the Russian River Valley with complex under-pinnings of mineral-laced earthiness. Broad but not hard in the palate, the wine mingles Bing cherry, brown sugar and spice from Rousseau barrels, and that hint of graphite which makes us sure this wine is only going to get better and better over time.",

    "other_notes":"Verve French Colombard comes from the “Domaine de Mirail” located in the heart of Gascony in southwest France. The specific site is in the Cotes de Gascogne region. Fermentation occurred in stainless steel, with the temperature stabilized to a very cool 59-62 degrees Fahrenheit in order to preserve the floral aromatics and fresh tropical and citrus fruit characteristics. Four months ageing on the lies adds a hint of creaminess and roundness to the wine’s texture, but does not mask the racy acidity typical of French Colombard from the Cotes de Gascogne. This wine is a bit riper and the fruit more concentrated and exotic than the 2007 French Colombard which is more mineral and focused. Served well-chilled, Verve French Colombard will prove a classic match with fish, oysters and other shellfish, salad or goat cheese.",

The wine enters full and rich, with flavors of blackberry, smoke, and gardenia. More approachable than the 2007 but with plenty of structure to age, this wine should be at its best between 2013 and 2022.",

Full-bodied but very harmonious, with suave tannins persisting through the long berry-laden finish. The new oak percentage is high for us but by using barrels that contribute texture and little in the way of flavor and aroma, the wood is already perfectly integrated. While enjoyable now, especially if decanted, this wine should be at its peak between 2013 and 2021.",

The initial aromas of ripe strawberries, dried fruit, and dust are complimented by wet dirt and herbs. The wine is fresh and vibrant on the front palate, with loads of red fruit and a dash of white pepper. The tannins of this Bordeaux varietal are present from start to finish, but without the normal astringency that can accompany it. Quite the opposite, the Rockpile Malbec exhibits a lush mouth feel with rich accents along the way. The youthful tannins on the finish make you aware that the wine will age gracefully for the next 8-10 years, but it is more than enjoyable now.",

If you haven't, prepare yourself for one of the best deals available on a white wine.We've gone on about Monsieur Brunel for some time now, and why not? Even today his wines receive a ton of praise. He's not just known for his red wines either. His white Châteauneuf-du-Papes are some of the finest, complex representations of the region. The 2010 Becassonne Blanc is not a far cry from CdP, and it is priced right in our sweet spot. Made from Roussanne (55%), Grenache Blanc (30%), and Clairette (15%), Brunel's white Côtes du Rhône trumps a lot of white Cdp's on the market today. Trumps them. Hands down; at a fraction of the price. One sip of this beauty will have you hooked. You'll get aromas of fresh stone fruit, citrus, and minerals, the palate is lively and balanced with a fleshy, round, white peachy middle all leading to a fine, crisp finish. It is a tremendously food-friendly wine and will suit anything from lobster thermidor to a chicken sandwich. Hmmm. Come to think of it, there's a holiday coming up that is known for a large celebratory feast. The 2010 André Brunel Domaine Becassonne Côtes du Rhône would suit the Turkey Day table to a T!

By no means simple, however, all this lifted fruit is underpinned by complex notes of tea-leaf, confectionary orange peel, and clean, wet brick. In a phrase: lollypop and loam! The wine's bright acidity and slightly firm tannins make it mouth-wateringly attractive now, and promise excellent future pleasure as well. It will match wonderfully with pork and richer preparations of chicken and salmon. Enjoy! ",

On the palate, incredibly concentrated with great weight and mouth-feel.  Seemingly darker and deeper than previous vintages.  Totally dry but at the same time Chambord-like with laser-like acidity to keep the mouth refreshed.  Papera Ranch is truly one of the great old-vine vineyards of California.  Enjoy this magnificent Zinfandel from release through 2017.",

The tannins are apparent, but the fruit is so concentrated that they seem to disappear in the mouth (though the do appear stronger after 30 minutes of aeration). The finish is polished off by the refreshing swipe of vibrant acidity. This wine will not doubt improve with some cellaring, but it may be hard to resist popping open bottles sooner rather than later.4/2011",

    "other_notes":"Full red. High-pitched red fruits, blood orange and minerals on the nose, with deeper black cardamom and cola notes arriving with air. Taut and sharply focused but concentrated as well, offering spicy black raspberry and bitter cherry flavors and a floral touch. Unwinds slowly and finishes with fine-grained tannins, youthful grip and impressive persistence. This is very promising but could use some air or bottle age",

Made in the style of a rose of Champagne, with gentle pressing of Syrah grapes to reveal a pretty pale color yet maintain delicacy in texture, followed by a cool fermentation to retain fruity and floral aromatics.  The Everett Ridge Syrah Rose is a mouthwatering and refreshing wine that you may wish to quaff by itself on a hot afternoon.  Still you will find this rose to be so food-friendly that it may become your wine of choice to stand in on any occasion as the ideal match for whatever you serve.

Youthful tannins (as there should be with this variety) build from the mid palate through the finish.  Given the voluptuous fruit, this wine can be enjoyed now with a good decant and a nice piece of beef.  But no rush.  I’m sure it will drink well for at least 15 years. (MRO – 01/17/12)",

(We prefer flavors of fruit, not wood.)  Quite rich and full bodied with a cornucopia of black and blue fruits joined by a hint of licorice and earth.  Youthful tannins (as there should be with this variety) build from the mid palate through the finish.  Given the voluptuous fruit, this wine can be enjoyed now with a good decant and a nice piece of beef.  But no rush.  I’m sure it will drink well for at least 15 years. (MRO – 01/17/12)",

Aromas of leather, cigar box, sweet tobacco and charred oak suspend over a dense backdrop of blackberry fruit. Layered and chewy tannins make a big textural statement in the mouth. The intensity of fruit is supported by mouthwatering acidity for a bright finish. Though bold, this wine is not a rough or coarse: it makes its grand exit with a well-mannered display of subtle tannins. Try decanting Petite Sirah, especially while it is in its youth, to enjoy its full aromatic complexity. Will mellow over time and can age up to 10 years. Pair this robust and muscly wine with equally big foods: grilled steak, lamb sausages, blackberry-glazed baby back ribs (or the spit-roasted wild boar from your last hunt!).",

    "other_notes":"The 2007 Cole Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon is a deeply colored and finely composed expresion of the vineyard at its best.  The aromas of black currant and olive are complemented by anise, sweet tobacco, coffee, allspice, and toasty oak.  Balanced and elegant, it possesses a firm structure, beginning as tighlty wound around a solid core and then unfolding on the palate into a fine-grained and smooth finish.  AGe for three to five years to evolve.  Pair this Cabernet Sauvignon with spring lamb chops with chopped parsly and min.",

Fortifying spirits were distilled by a local artisan distillery from estate-grown fruit. Through 5 years of barrel aging, this port has developed its lightly tawny color and shows sotness and ocmpelxity in flavors.  Rich, deep and intensely concentrated, with spiced black fig and distinctive nuttiness, the 2006 Everett Ridge Port possesses a full body and heady power.  You can expect this port to continue to improve over ten years of aging in the bottle.  Serve this sweet dessert wine accompanied by a plate of dark chocolates and toasted almonds for a divine finish to a meal.",

    "other_notes":"This is the second of two bottles, with the first one back in March. I opened this one yesterday, it comes with screw top so I simply put the cap on last night and back into the cellar. The aromatics on this wine are really true to the SLH teroir, with smoke and pepper. The color is very dark, stains the side of the glass. It's very easy to get fired up over CA syrah with these aromatics and color, just great. The palate is more medium weight with this bottle, as I thought I recalled the first bottle being bigger but this is really about medium weight, maybe medium plus but not by much. Lots of juicy dark fruit with black licorice, tar and lingering citrus. The chocolate and vanilla bean notes that emerge on the wine upon first being opened faded off since last night, too. This is really quite good, leaner with nice acid, juicy dark fruit and excellent color. A real nice showing for this young vineyard and as I said in my last note, which I'll affirm again, I'll add this to my annual Novy order of the SLH syrahs. Terrific. (282 views) - report issue | favorite authorTasted by Gestalted on 5/14/2012 & rated 94 points: Wow, I can't recall the last time I had a Syrah like this. First, it pours this beautiful black-purple, striking in color at the edges. The nose is this bright sweet blackberries-and-cream with nuances of pepper and smoke. The midpalate is this glycerin-like, silky texture yet has nice weight to it (very trademark Santa Lucia Highlands Syrah). Finish explodes with juicy black fruits, smoke and vanilla. I mean really juicy! This is how acidity is mastered. After each sip, I can't wait for the next. ",

Decomposed sandy soils make it impossible for the vine-pest phylloxera to survive, leaving these some of the last remaining self-rooted vines in the state. The berries are fermented whole, under a constant blanket of C02 until their native yeasts begin to ferment the grape sugars from the inside out.  Very rare to find in a domestic wine.

A surge of black cherry and currant aromas cascade into a generous complex of cherry, ripe olive, fennel, dried herb, and mocha flavors. Its smooth and supple mouthfeel leads to a dark sweet cherry, nutmeg and vanilla finish. Cellar for five to eight years to enjoy it in a peak of velvety teture, Drink it alongside roast beef or broiled lamb.",

The Everett Ridge Estate Syrah, with characteristic meaty flavors and dense tannins delivering mouthfuls of grip and power, is a muscular wine that’s tough enough to stand up to barbecue. A big blaze of peppery blackberry fruit fuses with char, tobacco and leather in the mouth. Bacon blue cheese burgers: ,meet your match!",

Flavors of Granny Smith apple and pear are infused with clover, basil, ginger and lemongrass. With yeasty richness of toasted brioche adding depth and textural complexity, the wine finishes with crsp acidity and an energetic hint of lime zest. Seize this wine in its youthful exuberance by enjoying within a year. Serve this bright and lively Sauvignon Blanc with spicy shrimp or on herbed goat cheese tart.",

This dark and brooding Petite Sirah is so deeply colored that it is nealry opaque, like ink. Aromas of leather, cigar box, sweet tobacco and charred oak suspend over a dense backdroop of blackberry fruit. Layered and chewy tannins make a big textural statement in the mouth. The inensit o fruit is supported by mouthwatering acidity for a bright finish. Though bold, this wine is not rough or coarse: it makes its grnad exit with a well-mannered display of subtle tannins. Will mellow over time and can age up to 10 years. Pair this robust and muscular wine with equally big foods: grilled steak, lamb sausages, blackberry glazed baby back ribs or the spit-roasted wild boar from your last hunt.",

An unrestrained Pinot, the 2011 is laced with wild animal notes throughout. This is another of the more powerful, angular Pinots in the range, but there is no shortage of personality or intrigue.”",

On the palate, the wine is mid-weight, with more red raspberry fruits though there are some darker fruit flavors hiding underneath.  There are hints of herbs and dried leaves (probably from the use of whole clusters in the ferment) along with some vanilla from the oak.  The wine still shows some baby fat, but is certainly a great candidate for the cellar. 92pts “Cellar Selection” Wine Enthusiast",

Plenty of blackberry and blueberry fruit to buffer the tannins. Reminds me a lot of the 2006 when it was released (which happens to be drinking fabulously now). Give this three to four years in the cellar and then enjoy the show until 2023.",

Curiously, and I’ve noticed this in the last few vintages, no ruby-red grapefruit as is typically expressed by this site. On the palate, a beautiful mid-weight presence with near perfect texture and mouthfeel. Blueberries and savory herbs persist in the mildly tannic finish. Enjoy this Syrah from 2015 through 2023.",

The wine certainly shows the rich fruit that Keefer is known for, but that is tempered with a more earthy, mineral char- acter than we usually see in this wine. We believe that this additional complexity will only allow the wine to become more compelling with the passage of time.",

A drop-dead beauty, the 2012 Pinot Noir Cargasacchi Vineyard is one of the most beautiful wines I have ever tasted from this site, where so often the wines are wild and animalisitic.

The 2012 Dry Riesling starts with citrus hints, primarily lime and grapefruit, and a floral-honey aroma, too. The flavors that stand out for us are the green apple, peach, pear and lemon. With its great acidity, this Riesling goes great with light fish and seafood, such as grilled shrimp with a lime and mango salsa.",

As usual, you get lots of black cherry and cassis aromas, with a welcome hint of French oak. The mouth has firm structure, wiht plenty of tannins and enough acidity to compliment even the biggest foods. The cherry, plum and berry flavors are complimented by the cola, and cocoa notes. if you like to grill, enjoy a tri-tip or a filet with this one. Feel free to enjoy it by itself. This Cabernet Sauvignon will continue to evolve and get better over the next eight years.",

This wine has lots of blackberry, pepper, clove and anise aromas. The initial, upfront flavors are blackberry and blueberries. Again, however, there is plenty of spice and some dark chocolate, too. Although the wine is ripe, there is good balance. Our Zinfnadel is ready to drink now, and should be wonderful for the next five years. Chicken cacciatore or a rosemary turkey casserole would be great matches for this one.",

This is a great “drink now” wine that would go brilliantly with grilled garden vegetables, especially asparagus, or fresh seafood like oysters or scallosp in a spring green salad.",

The nose is all about weight’ meaty and leather with hints of clove, black pepper and cigar box, tricking you into thinking this wine will be all power and no finesse. But the tides turn with the first taste’ full of bright ripe black berries, vanilla bean, anise and a note of cran berry tartness. the wine has firm structural tannins to create a plesan tbut not overbearing mouthfeel, and a long finish that brings you back around to that first initial impression fo weight an depth. This wine will pair well with a filet mignon in a red wine and balsamic reduction, or a juicy burger and duck fat fries. Drinking well now, but can age easily for 5-10 years.",

The wine has a complex palate of ripe fig, black currants and plums; vivid, but integrated acidity carries through to a long finish filled with dried cranberries, clove, vanilla, morels and forest floor. This is a wine that obviously pairs perfectly with pizza or pasta, but would also make a great tapas wine; it evolves constantly in the glass and is up to the challenge of matching both light and heavy dishes. This wine is ready to dirnk, but could also be cellared for up to five years. ",

The finish is long, with sweet milk chocolate, and its elegant tannin and acid structure promises a long window of enjoyment.",

Offering immediate pleasure, the wine is plump and juicy, yet with a complex earthy spiciness: a result of sustainably farmed, balanced older vines rooted deep into the silt, sand and gravel soils of the Salinas River Valley of Monterey.",

Janka displays a beautiful golden color, and offers aromas and flavors of dried apricot and golden raisins laced with classic varietal “gewurz” spices of white pepper, fennel seed and coriander.  In the mouth, this wine is lush and viscous and its exceptionally long finish evokes crème brûlée with orange zest.  Serve chilled, but let it warm and expand in the glass.  Kept in the refrigerator, it will remain fresh after opening for up three weeks.",

    "other_notes":"The Carlisle Vineyard always shows a bit ore “Rhone-like” than the Papera Vineyard Zinfandel, which is no surprise given the higher percentage of “mixed blacks” in the vineyard. The 2013 Zinfandel Carlisle Vineyard hits the palate with an intriguing melange of dark blue and purplish fruit, sweet psices, tobacco, cedar and lavender. Exotic and juicy to the core, the Carlisle is another delicious red from Novy.",

In this vintage, the Papera is decidedly more powerful, mos tof that a conscious decision by Adam Lee to give the wine more darkness and overall intensity, qualities this site seems to generate in abundance on its own.",
